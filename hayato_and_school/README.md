This is my current best solution to the problem 1780A "Hayato And School", which is an 800 rated problem. My current solution has been accepted, and hence I consider it to be complete. Of course, as always, if I can think of a more efficient solution, I shall return to the problem. 

Problem statement: Given an array of of positive integers, is it possible for any triplet of them to have an odd sum? If so, return the indices (1- indexed) of these integers in the array.

Method: The trick to this question is that given any sequence of three integers, the only requirements for an odd sum are that all three are odd or exactly 2 are even and 1 is odd. Therefore, we can loop through the array, counting the number of odd and even integers (with a basic mod 2 check) and ensure that there are either more than 3 odd integers, or more than 1 odd integer and more than 2 even integers in the array. We can store their indices in a separate array, and then print it out if it is true. If it is false, we print out "NO\n".
