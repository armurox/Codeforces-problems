This is my current best solution to the problem 1844A "Subtraction Game", which is an 800 rated problem. My current solution has been accepted, and hence I consider it to be complete. Of course, as always, if I can think of a more efficient solution, I shall return to the problem. 

Problem statement: Given any two integer a and b, Player 1 and Player 2 are given an integer n, from which, turn by turn, each player can subtract either a or b from n. Find n such that Player 2 always has a winning strategy

Method: I chose to take the sum of a and b as n, that way, no matter what Player 1 chose, Player 2 would choose the other option and win.
