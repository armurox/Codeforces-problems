This is my current best set of solutions to the problem 1806A "Walking Master", which is an 800 rated problem. My solutions have been accepted, so I consider them to be complete. It is important to note that the algorithms behind the python and C solutions are different. The C solution is much more inefficient (essentially constantly incrementing in a while loop until the appropriate solution is achieved), which works as C is much faster than Python. Therefore, those looking for a more algorithmically efficient solution are advised to look at the Python solution, as it is not quite as brute-forced. As always, if I can think of more efficient solutions, I shall return to the problem
