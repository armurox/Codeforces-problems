This is my current solution to the problem 1807A "Plus or Minus", which is an 800 rated problem. My current solution has been accepted, hence I consider it to be complete. As always, if I can think of a more efficient solution, I shall return to this problem (however, I think that is unlikely, as this problem is extremely simple for an 800 rated problem). My solution is available in Python and C.
