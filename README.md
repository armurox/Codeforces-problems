# Summary
These are solutions that I am actively working on and updating for Codeforces problems. Some are problems I have solved while practising, and some will be my live solutions from contests. The solutions to the problems will be in a mix of C, C++ and Python. I will also aim to try and put up versions of the solutions in all three languages whenever possible.
