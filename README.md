These are solutions that I am actively working on and updating for Codeforces problems. They are commonly solved past problems. My solutions are sometimes split into headers and different files, if I had the time to refactor my code in that way, although more often than not, you will see it all in one file, as I probably I chose to code directly in the Codeforces IDE or the problem was coded during a contest, where writing Makefiles and header files would waste time. The solutions to the problems will be in a mix of C, C++ and Python. I will also aim to try and put up versions of the solutions in all three languages whenever possible.
