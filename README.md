# Summary
These are solutions that I am actively working on and updating for Codeforces problems. Some are problems I have solved while practising, and some will be my live solutions from contests. The solutions to the problems will be in a mix of C, C++ and Python. I will also aim to try and put up versions of the solutions in all three languages whenever possible.

## Some side points
You mat also see some files where I have included the editorial method. This is mainly done in two cases. If:
1. I got very stuck, and was unable to come up with a solution after a few days of thought.
2. I came up with a solution that passed all the tests, but was still somewhat unsatisfied with it, efficiency, or elegance wise.
