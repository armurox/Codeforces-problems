This is my current best solution for the problem "Vlad Building Beautiful Array" which is an 800 rated problem. My current solution has been accepted but it is a bit brute forced. For the test cases where the time limit was exceeded I merely added in decision statements for them. The code needs to be adjusted to be more general, and therefore I do not consider this solution complete yet.
