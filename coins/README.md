This is my current best solution to the problem 1814A "Coins". My current solution has been accepted, and hence I consider it to be complete. NOTE: There appears to be an error in the problem definition on code forces, as non-negative integers appear to be allowed when the tests ran. As always, I will return to this problem if I can think of a more efficient solution. Python and C++ versions of the solution also forthcoming.
