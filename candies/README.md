This is my current best solution to problem 1810B "Candies", which is an 800 rated problem. The current solution has been accepted, and therefore I consider it to be complete. (Note: The solution I came up with is recursive, and hence used up a lot of memory). As always, if I come up with a more efficient solution, I will come back to the problem, but at the moment, I consider it to be complete.
