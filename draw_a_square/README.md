# Problem 2074A "Draw a square"
This is my current best solution to the problem 2092A "Kamilka and the sheep", which is an 800 rated problem. My current solution has been accepted, and hence I consider it to be complete. Of course, as always, if I can think of a more efficient solution, I shall return to the problem. 

## Problem statement
Given a set of 4 integers $l, r, d, u$ representing 4 coordinates on an x, y grid, individuall $(-l, 0)$, $(r, 0)$, $(0, -d)$, $(0, u)$, determine if a square can be constructed.

## Method
If all 4 integers are equal, only then will they form a square.
